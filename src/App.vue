          I am a developer who believes in the intersection of logic and creativity. My journey
          began with a curiosity for how things work on the web, which quickly evolved into a
          passion for building robust, scalable applications.

        <p>
          With a background in full-stack development, I handle everything from database
          architecture to pixel-perfect frontend implementation. I don't just write code; I build
          solutions that prioritize performance, accessibility, and user experience.
